No tutorial in the first week of class! However, make sure you've done the following:

 - Set up your compiler, added it to your PATH. Instructions for this can be found in the course notes, or [here](http://www.codebind.com/cprogramming/install-mingw-windows-10-gcc/).

 - Looked at and completed exercise 0 (once it comes out).

 - Got yourself a good code editor (I highly recommend [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). Avoid using
    IDEs since you're going to have to get used to the command line eventually - better now than later! A good
    code editor can help you:
    - Find syntax errors in your code as you write it
    - Save you a lot of time from debugging later
    - Help you keep track of your files and edit history (using version control)
    - Speed up your development workflow
    - Keep your code well formatted automatically


 - Read the notes and attempted the exercises in them. Learning C can be difficult for the first time, and the only
    way to get good at it is to practice. You have tons of help available, make sure you use it!
